# I fucking hate this shit.

* Javascript sucks
	* React especially sucks
	* web 1.0 was the best
	* typescript was marginally better than react
	* my brain doesn't understand props/state

```
rm -rf 'life'
```

hahahaha I got a 22% on that test. How do people's brains understand this shit? 

## UPDATE

I left the course in favor of pursing a cybersecurity role. The thought of writing code like that for years crippled me with anxiety.
